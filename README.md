# SmartiesCounting
### Smarties Counting Problem

When I eat my Smarties I always eat the red ones last. I separate them into their color groups and I start by eating the orange ones, then blue, green, yellow, pink, violet, brown and finally red. The red ones are the best, so I eat them slowly one at a time. The other colors I eat quickly by the handful (my hand can hold a maximum of 7 Smarties). I always finish all the Smarties of one color before I move on to the next, so sometimes the last handful of a color isn’t a full one.

But wait, there’s more! I have turned my Smartie-eating into a science. I know it always takes me exactly 13 seconds to eat a handful of non-red Smarties and I adjust my chewing rate so that I always take 13 seconds even if my hand is not completely full. When I eat the red Smarties I like to take my time, so it takes me exactly 16 seconds to eat each one. I have a big box of Smarties. After I’ve finished sorting the colors, how long will it take me to eat them?

The input will contain 10 test cases. Each test case will start with N lines (50≤N≤200), where each line holds the color of a single Smartie in lower case.  Your program should output a single line for each test case indicating how long (in seconds) it will take me to eat the entire box according to the rules given above. Note that the sample input below only contains 1 test case, but the real data files will contain 10.
